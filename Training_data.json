NLB is particularly useful for ensuring that stateless applications, such as a Web server running Internet Information Services (IIS), are scalable by adding additional servers as the load increases. \n· Enabling Kerberos Authentication Mechanism For SharePoint environment: \nKerberos is a secure protocol that grants authentication tickets if the client’s request to the Key Distribution Centre (KDC) contains valid user credentials and a valid Service Principal Name (SPN). Kerberos is the preferred authentication type for SharePoint because it is faster, more secure, and reduces the number of errors you can get with username and passwords than NTLM. If the SharePoint website uses external data (located on different servers than the SharePoint server itself) ex. to SQL databases through web parts the SharePoint server needs Kerberos to delegate the client credentials (the credentials are never sent over the wire, only tickets which the KDC keeps track of). \nSoftware Data India Limited, New Delhi (Apr’07 – Feb’10) Associate\nTitle: Global Project Management Tool for Data Inc Corporation\n        Tools: Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, MS Project Server 2007\n\n· Reading the project server object model and Updating a SharePoint List. \n· Created an application to read the project server object model and update a Milestones list on the SharePoint site checking if the tasks are milestones. \n· Web application for creating a blank project plan or publish an already existing project plan. \n· SharePoint Workflow Template for sending an Email. \n· Windows application to be installed on client location for associating a workflow template with a SharePoint List or Document Library. \n· Web Application to set the audience of the SharePoint Navigation. \n· Windows service to populate the Enterprise Dashboard and Enterprise Site containing SharePoint Lists and Document Libraries.\n\n       Title:Project Management Tool  \nThis project is developed using Microsoft Office Share point Server 2007.It is mainly targeted at tracking the internal project‘s progress for the company.

GTX can be called as backbone of FMS application, which connects all the backend channels through multi-connectors and delivers web services to external applications in the context of service oriented architecture (SOA).\nSWIFT- Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication is a network established to have common standards for financial transactions and a shared data processing system.\n\nThe main components of FMS application are:\nCBT - Computer Based Terminal, message validation takes place and gets distributed to different nodes.\nNPI - Network processing Integration, inbound/outbound messages are processed.\n\nGT Bridge - is a layer through which the messages are flown from CBT/NPI as well as to the backend channels. This layer is responsible for delivery/failure of messages.\nOMS - Output Management System, a DB developed product which handles all printing/emails.\n\nMessage types:\n\nMT940 - regular basis statement.\n\nMT942 - interim statement sent to the customer on their request.\nMT950 – statements sent directly to the customer.\n\nComing to the application architecture, FMS uses the Resilience concept (Cross configuration), 2 decoupled active instances that replicate their data to the other side. This concept justifies that a failure of one instance does not harm continuous processing of the remaining instance.\nROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES: -   \n\n· Involved in Second Level Production Support handling various critical issues & participate during outages for resolution of issues.\n\n· Analyzing logs and fixing the issues and supporting business user’s queries.\n\n· Ensure proper escalation matrix is followed based on the applications.\n\n· Ensure all tickets that are raised adhere to the defined SLA.\n\n· Ensure Quality Incident tickets are raised & resolved.\n\n· Interacting with Clients for requirement gathering and clarifications when new applications are on boarded.\n\n· Involved in change request processing, solving production issues.\n\n· Involved in Documentation & creating KEDB, report generation.\n\n· Responsible for analyzing the monthly tickets data and ensuring automation of manual activities.\n\n· Performing Proactive checks to ensure stability of the applications.\n\n· Application/Batch Monitoring and Health Check activities (SOW/EOW).\n· Responsible for resolving Day to Day and critical Production issues within the stipulate SLA.\n\n· Coordinating with upstream and downstream teams for weekend release and maintenance activities.\n\n· Updating KEDB and raising KCS articles for the team to follow.\n· Having good knowledge on .net deployment.\nPERSONAL DETAILS\n\n· Name\n               \n:\nPRAMODH KUMAR M\n\n· Father's name\n\n:\nMUNIYAPPA D\n\n· Date of birth\n\n:\n03-08-1989\n\n· Nationality       \n \n:\nINDIAN\n\n· Marital status\n\n:\nSINGLE\n\n· Permanent Address       \n: \n#351, 6TH Cross, Ambedkar Nagar,\n\nWhitefield Post, Blore-560066\n\n· Hobbies\n\n:      \nSurfing latest technologies & Current affairs on Internet,      \nListening songs\n\nDECLARATION\n\nI hereby declare that the information furnished above is true to best of my knowledge.\n\nDate:\nPlace: Bangalore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PRAMODH KUMAR .M)\n\n\n\nPage 5","annotation":[{"label":["Name"],"points":[{"start":14474,"end":14489,"text":"PRAMODH KUMAR .M"}]},{"label":["LOCATION"],"points":[{"start":14455,"end":14463,"text":"Bangalore"}]},{"label":["PROJECT DESCRIPTION"],"points":[{"start":10937,"end":11381,"text":"Financial Messaging System is software application within DB, responsible for the successful implementation of the new financial messaging solution.

BIP’s design philosophy is to make the data reusable across different project implementations and available to different banking users. Using different tools to connect to BIP, different teams are enabled to support MIS, Analytics, and even regulatory reporting requirements. \n\nThe overview of data flow and data transformation from source applications to the different BIP layers then to the downstream marts and views\n\nProcess begins where data are extracted from source files and processed in Informatica to handle data type exceptions and to complete other file validations. Data is then loaded to OIA (Operational Image Area) after source key validation for full files or for maintenance of snapshots where incremental data from source is received or for maintaining history, if applicable. Data exceptions are loaded to separate tables for tracking/resolution.\n\nData from OIA are transformed based on the source-to-target mapping specifications and BMAP/reference table validations to fit into the BIP Common Data Model (CDM) / SIM (Simplified Integrated Model) and to consolidate/apply changes to the CDM/SIM history tables. \n\nData from CDM/SIM are extracted and transformed for downstream usage. Transient tables may be utilized to simplify complex transformations. Transformation of target reference values to the business values are also performed in this layer. \n\nTransformed data from CDM/SIM layer are loaded to downstream target tables for commonly-used information and user-driven requirements.. \n\nTransformed and untransformed views are made available to downstream users for reporting, analysis, and data mining via different reporting tools such as SAS, Qlikview, BO, etc. \n\n\t \n\tProject Contribution:- Data Modelling for 200 + URs ( User Requests)\n- Data Modelling for Regionalization Project ( GDW HK to BIP - SG Migration)\n- Data Modelling for CDM / SIM, ADM, XTR, CRA DB.\n- Review of Data Mapping Sheets (Prepared by Data Analyst)\n- Management of BMAP Sheets for Reference Data.\n- Tools used: ER win 13.x / Model Mart\n- Database : Teradata / Hive (Hadoop)\n- Industry: Banking\n \n\n\t11/2014 - 05/2015\n\t(Royal Bank of Scotland(RBS))\n\n\t7 month(s)\n\tRBS -SVoC Enterprise Data warehouse Programme\n\n\t \n\tProject Description:In 2011 RBS began a programme of work to implement a cross functional Strategic Data Warehouse in the UK, using Informatica as the ETL tool, Teradata as the underlying technology platform for the database, SAS as the analytics toolset and an industry standard data model tailored for use in RBS to structure the data (RBS-LDM).\n\nThe intent of the Retail Data Warehouse programme is to provide an EDW which has data elements from Core and Non Core systems.
